      <h2>Khairan's Mobile Legends Review</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p align="justify">
        Mobile Legends is a fighting game in which 5 players compete in a team
        against another 5. You can choose characters that have magic or physical
        ability. There are 6 roles – marksman, tank, support, fighter, mage and
        assassin. Tank, support, fighter and assassin are melee, though some
        support can be magic (shoot from afar). Marksmen can also shoot from
        far, like mages, but mages fight using magic. Optimally, each player
        should choose a different role on the team, even though there is no such
        rule to do so. The person with retribution (a spell where you can
        decrease the monsters’ health) must destroy the monsters around the map
        to buff (increase their character’s strength). You can also buy items,
        such as magical and physical items. Roaming items can also be bought for
        tank and support, which allows you not to share your gold and experience
        with your teammates. After ten minutes, there will be a lord whom, if
        you attack it, will follow one direction and destroy the enemies turret.
        The minions (there are 3 minions in each team which come out every 30
        seconds which are used to destroy the enemies’ turret) will become very
        strong.
      </p>
      <h3>Graphics</h3>
      <p align="justify">
        While you are playing the game, at the top left corner, there is a map
        that shows where your teammates are and where the monsters are. It also
        shows enemies when your teammates see them. At the bottom right corner,
        there are controls for power. The bottom left corner contains controls
        for moving around. There is a 3rd person camera for the player to view
        the character and surroundings. There is grass everywhere. At the middle
        of the map, there is a river. There are frogs jumping and fishes
        swimming. At the sides of the map, there will be a gigantic turtle that
        gives gold to the whole team. The person who kills the turtle will
        become very strong.
      </p>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p align="justify">
        I like the wide variety of options for choosing a character to play.
        Sometimes, the interaction with teammates is not good. At times, they
        may ask you to do things that you may not be willing to do (such as when
        to attack) and if you choose not to do so, they may trash-talk you.
        Overall, you may enjoy this game and can give it a try by downloading it
        on Android Play Store or iPhone App store.
